# Problems
- I did not had any social accounts, I had to create new ones.
- I also did not had a CV, I had made one.
- I had to choose a topic to talk about in one of the pages and I did not know what to talk about.
- For the degree part I did a table to put the contents of the degree and it took to long to make.

# Description of my work
- I put a schedule to start the project the 21st of December to make sure I had time to make the Web page, which objective was to divide the days of work between the pages the profesor put.
- Then I started the first day doing the index.
- The second day was dedicated to the contact me part.
- The third day was dedicated to the degree part, the next day was the 24 of December, this day i did not do anything.
- The 25th I finished the Degree part and started the about me.
- The 26th I put in the about me part and also made and put in the repo the fce part(only able to go to it from the degree part).
