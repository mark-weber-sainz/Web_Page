                AI can be applied to many fields, and one of them is the videogame sector. Within this industry, AI has numerous applications, 
                ranging from making non-playable characters (NPCs) appear more human to creating entire planets, as seen in <strong>No Man's Sky</strong>.

                <h3>1. The Seed System</h3>
                <p>
                    Everything starts with a "seed," which acts as a unique identifier for the planet. This ensures that once a planet is discovered, 
                    it remains the same for all players across the universe.

                <h3>2. Terrain and Relief</h3>
                <p>
                    The algorithm uses "noise" functions to generate the planet's relief and topography. Once the terrain is defined, 
                    the system chooses a "layer" or biome based on the planet's distance from its sun.

                <h3>3. Environment and Biology</h3>
                <p>
                    Colors, flora, and fauna are determined by variables such as temperature and humidity. For plants, the game uses specific 
                    "grammars" to dictate growth patterns.

                <h3>4. Mathematical Foundations</h3>
                <p>
                    A variant of <strong>Johan Gielis' Superformula</strong> is used for creatures and certain plants. This mathematical formula 
                    can create a vast range of shapes, from perfect circles to complex flower petals, offering immense creative variety.

                <h3>5. Optimization and Rules</h3>
                <p>
                    The game features a Level of Detail (LOD) system: when you are far from a planet, it is generated in a simple way. 
                    As you land, the algorithm executes the high-detail generation that gives the planet its unique touch. 
                    Finally, a set of rules prevents the procedural generation from becoming chaotic or broken.

                This is how the AI in this specific game works, but there are countless other functions AI can fulfill when creating a modern videogame.
